                Apache CouchDB can serve applications written using familiar Ajax patterns, using no middle-tier application server. Standalone CouchApps are quick and easy to develop, as well as being easily portable. They are ideal for in-house or education projects, as well as opening up novel opportunities using CouchDB's peer-based replication. In this talk I'll walk you through hello world with CouchApps, and then explain some of the new possibilities they open up.

With the development cycle of new applications shrinking, and the scope of those applications becoming more focussed, the ability to deploy, and scale new applications is becoming a critical to any businesses success.  <a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyent's Smart Platform</a> is an open source Platform-as-a-Service, letting developers to build scalable, complex web applications in JavaScript that runs on the server, and then deploy those applications into the "cloud" using Git.

The talk will outline some of the economic imperatives for the rise of a the Platform-as-a-Service, discuss the need for not only open standards, but open source, and demonstrate some of the Smart Platform's capabilities.

                Bending JavaScript to your will, or why testing JavaScript in the browser can drive you crazy: This talk will cover the previously untold story of Selenium's JavaScript internals. You'll learn how Selenium had to trick the browser's single-threaded JavaScript engine into a continuation machine to wait for things like page loads or returned Ajax messages. You'll also learn how Selenium could have used Brendan Eich's Narcissus meta-circular JavaScript interpreter to clean up the mess, and why Narcissus is just really run to play with. (Hint: You can use Narcissus as a code pre-processor to tweak JavaScript into your own little language. Want optional parens on function calls? Done!)

                This session will provide a high level overview of the Objective-J language and Cappuccino frameworks.  We'll spend a short period of time discussing both these technologies and the reasoning behind them.  Then we'll dive right into showing you how to use them to create beautiful and immersive user interfaces for your web applications that parallel those found on the desktop.  We'll cover how to add features such as drag and drop, copy/paste, undo/redo, and autosave.

                Learning jQuery UI: Built on top of jQuery, jQuery UI is a complete set of behaviors and components for building Rich Internet Applications. Drag-and-drop, resizing, sorting, selecting, dialogs, sliders, tabs, trees, grids, toolbars, menus, etc. Each component adheres to a consistent standard across API, design, behavior and theming, minimizing surprise and making learning all of them as easy as learning one. jQuery UI has full cross-browser support, is designed for easy customizing and extensibility, and is fully themable with a widget-ready CSS Framework.

                Interoperable Client/Server JavaScript Web Applications - With the growing set of libraries, tools, and frameworks for JavaScript on both the client and server-side, and the rapid adoption of JSON as the standard data format of the web, developing web applications with a natural end-to-end intuitive JavaScript model is becoming a reality. We look at emerging conventions and specifications for JSON-based data interaction that provide high levels of correlation with the JavaScript data structures and build upon the REST architecture for highly interoperable modular client/server applications. On the client side, we look at how Dojo utilizes a  service oriented approach with JSON-RPC or HTTP/REST with JSON referencing for data driven widgets with standards based communications. On the server side, we will see how the REST architecture combined can be combined with a JavaScript server side environment with natural object persistence and JSON schema defined class structures with Persevere, and demonstrate powerful client/server capabilities such a Comet-driven data notifications and JSON-RPC based method calls.
